## AI Virtual Keyboard:
This is a simple virtual keyboard that works with gestures using OpenCV.


## Outcome:
Look for yourself in this <a href="#">video</a>.


## What Have I Done:
Firstly, I have created a Hand Tracking Module using openCV and MediaPipe. Then, I have created my AI Virtual Keyboard using OpenCV and Pynput.

OpenCV is a library used for computer vision applications. With help of OpenCV, we can build an enormous number of applications that work better in real-time. Mainly it is used for image and video processing.

MediaPipe is a framework mainly used for building audio, video, or any time series data. With the help of the MediaPipe framework, we can build very impressive pipelines for different media processing functions.

Pynput is a library that allows us to control and monitor input devices. It contains subpackages for each type of input device supported.


## Required Packages:
- opencv-python
- mediapipe
- pynput


## Usage:
- First of all you need to install all required packages. 
- Then run the AIVirtualKeyboard.py file. 
- Now use one finger to hover on the keyboard.
- Join your index finger and middle finger for make a click on keyboard.
- If you want you can open Notepad or TextEdit for getting input in there.


## Got a Question?
What to know more about my working process? Have an exciting project that could use my help? Drop me a line and Iâ€™ll try my best to get back to you!

If you have any questions that are bothering you please contact with me. If you think a line is redundant or can be removed to make the program better then you can obviously ask me or make a pull request.
