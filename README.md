## AI Virtual Keyboard:
This is a simple virtual keyboard that works with gestures using OpenCV. We will use our hand in the air to click on the keyboard.


## Outcome:
Look for yourself in this <a href="#">video</a>.


## What Have I Done:
Firstly, I've created a Hand Tracking Module using openCV, MediaPipe and Math. Then, I've created my AI Virtual Keyboard using OpenCV, Pynput, Time and Previously created Hand Tracking Module.

OpenCV is a library used for computer vision applications. With help of OpenCV, we can build an enormous number of applications that work better in real-time. Mainly it's used for image and video processing.

MediaPipe is a framework mainly used for building audio, video, or any time series data. With the help of the MediaPipe framework, we can build very impressive pipelines for different media processing functions.

Math is a built-in module that we can use for mathematical tasks.

Pynput is a library that allows us to control and monitor input devices. It contains subpackages for each type of input device supported.

Time is a built-in module that we can use for handle time-related tasks.


## Required Packages:
- opencv-python
- mediapipe
- pynput


## Usage:
- First of all you need to install all required packages. 
- Then run the AIVirtualKeyboard.py file. 
- Now rise your hand in-front of your camera.
- Use one finger to hover on the keyboard.
- Join your index and middle finger for make a click on your expected key.
- If you want you can open Notepad or TextEdit for getting input in there.
